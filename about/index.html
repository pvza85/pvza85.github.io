	<p>I started programming from junior year of high school with QBasic and I really fall in love with it. I was the only one 
	at our class that could be able to finish all homeworks. At that years I have decided to continue my studies at computer engineering.</p>
	<p>At Tabriz University (in top ten unversity in Iran) I was always great at programming, Data Scturcture, Algorithms and Artificial Intelligence. At that time the most prominent programming contest between Bachlore students was ACM/ICPC that I have
	joined them at university at my 3rd and 4th year that in both I was the top competitor and as captain of our team joined competitions in Asian Region. Also at university I was the only 
	undergraduate TA in our faculty for Programming Course twice.</p>
	<p>I have developed a program for Exam Scheduling as my BS final project using Genetic Algorithms that still in use there.</p>
	<p>During last years of Universty I have started to work as part time and then as full time in various companies with various
	technologies including C++, C#, PHP, MySQL, MS SQL and under different Software Engineering methods. And fortunately I was lucky to be in a fast 
	growing company and become team leader and project manager at that company in 2 years. But the project that I was most proud of it was a
	 learning system for Elevators. We gathered information and using this data designed an algorithm based on Statistical Methods (something like Byesian) 
	 that learn residents of a building behaviours and tries to minimize the elevator journey distance and responce time. It was successful 
	 beyond my expectation and with help from System Developers we load it over all Micro Processors. The result was 15-20%
	 enhancement in responce time and electric usage.</p>
